This is a controller-based .NET 9 web API implemented in C# and ASP.NET Core, which demonstrates how to integrate .NET (core) with the distributed SQL database from CockcoachDB.

The API use the educational movr database hosted on CockroachDB Cloud and the Npgsql Entity framework core driver for PostgreSQL integration.

You will need to sign up for a free account at CockroachDB Cloud to test the API, and update the connectionstring to connect with your own account.

I have no affiliation with CockcoachDB or any of their offerings. I am interested in distributed computing in general.
